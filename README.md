# Curses-Engine
Console 'engine' for games with text graphics, based on PDCurses
(Actually it is a simple snake game)

To try it out, go to releases and download the latest one. It should run OK on Win10 and a 1080p or bigger screen. Otherwise not guaranteed :D

I have followed many tutorials on how to make a simple game (snake, minesweeper, etc), but that was always with the help of some premade framework.
In this project I decided to do something entirely from scratch, and in console for simplicity. The only external library I used is PDCurses,
because I found Windows terminal related API a bit inconvenient.
