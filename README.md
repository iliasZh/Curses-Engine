# Snake console game
A simple snake game in Windows command prompt.

To try it out, go to releases and download the latest one. It should run OK on Win10 64-bit and a 1080p or bigger screen. Otherwise not guaranteed :D

I have followed many tutorials on how to make a simple game (snake, minesweeper, etc), but that was always with the help of some premade framework.
In this project I decided to do something entirely from scratch, and in console for simplicity. The only external library I used is PDCurses,
because I found Windows terminal related API a bit inconvenient.

# How to build

This project is abandoned, but it probalby *may* be built as is, assuming you built and linked PDCurses.
Go check out the [newer repo](https://github.com/iliasZh/console-engine) with (hopefully) much better code.
It is meant to be a 3d rendering engine - rasterizer, not a raytracer. I haven't built any games on top of it yet, though :(
